Kishi Kaisei literally translates to "Wake from death and return to life". Meaning "To come out of a desperate situation and make a complete return in one sudden burst". The removal of the pinky is a nod to Yubitsume. A Japanese ritual usually practiced by the Yakuza to show sincere apology and to atone for offenses to another, by means of amputating portions of one's own little finger.
