A couple of years ago, I sent a text Sam on Instagram, long before ChatGPT, when he wasn't as famous as he is today. I don't remember exactly when I first discovered him; it was probably around the time I first saw the "How to Start a Startup" lecture. I learned a lot from that class, and then I discovered his blog. After reading through numerous blog posts, I sent him a message.

Surprisingly, he did respond and gave me just a couple of lines of advice. It turned out to be pretty good advice though...
